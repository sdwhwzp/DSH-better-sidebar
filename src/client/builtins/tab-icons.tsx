/**
 * The built-in tab glyphs, in color.
 *
 * Every built-in tab type and the incoming 8th (changes) declare their icon
 * here, so the three surfaces that draw a tab's glyph — the bottom workbench's
 * tab strip, the native right Sidebar's guide capsules and its tab chips — all
 * read the same colorful glyph from `descriptor.icon`.
 *
 * The color always arrives from a theme token, never from the plugin: the
 * glyph is a VSCodicon drawn in `currentColor`, and the wrapper class supplies
 * that color. A skin therefore keeps control of everything (the guide's §12);
 * this module is what `tests/theme.spec.ts` checks for color literals.
 *
 * `files` is the one exception in kind rather than in color: it renders DSH's
 * own folder artwork (`FileTypeIcon`), matching the file rows this tab shows.
