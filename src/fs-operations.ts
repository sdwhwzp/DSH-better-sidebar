/**
 * File mutations for the sidebar (the upload route and the tree's renames,
 * deletes and mkdirs).
 *
 * ⚠️ **No workspace containment any more.** The guard was removed at the
 * user's request, so these operations reach whatever the HOST USER can reach.
 * What is still enforced is the SHAPE of a request: the relative upload path
 * is sanitized (absolute paths, '.', '..' and empty segments are refused), a
 * rename/mkdir name must be one path segment, an existing destination is
 * refused instead of clobbered, and the session workspace root itself is never
 * renamable or removable. Bytes stream from the request body to a uniquely
 * named temp sibling and are renamed into place, so a failed, aborted, or
 * oversized upload never leaves a partial file at the target path.
 *
 * The tree's rename/delete are link-aware: they address the LEXICAL row path
 * (lstat decides), so renaming or deleting a symlink row renames/unlinks the
 * LINK, never its target — matching what the tree row visually names (VS Code
 * semantics). Every mutation invalidates the directory cache of the level(s)
 * it touched.
