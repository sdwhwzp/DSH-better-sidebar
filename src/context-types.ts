/**
 * Structural types for the cordis services this plugin consumes, plus the
 * Context face both halves share.
 *
 * The type base is the vendored `@deepseek-ai/cordis` Context (the runtime
 * DSH actually runs); the service members this plugin touches are restated
 * below as structural mirrors and combined with the base by INTERSECTION.
 * Intersection (not `declare module` augmentation) is deliberate: DSH's own
 * packages already augment `@deepseek-ai/cordis`, and the host and client
 * packages declare *different* types for the same member — host
 * `sessions: SessionStore` vs client runtime `sessions: ISessions` — so a
 * single program that re-declares them would fail interface merging
 * (TS2717). Intersecting keeps every face available and lets each call site
 * resolve against the member it needs without any module-level conflict.
 *
 * `effect`, `get`, `provide`, `inject`, `logger`, `emit`, `isolate` and the
 * event helpers come from the vendored cordis base and are intentionally NOT
 * restated here: their strict shapes are the runtime contract (e.g. an
 * effect body must return a disposer). Only the string-keyed session-feed
 * `on` overload is added, because the cordis `on` is keyed to its own
 * typed `Events` map and the harness session feed is a plain string event.
 *
 * This file must stay FREE of Node.js types (`node:http`, `node:stream`,
 * `Buffer`): it is part of the CLIENT-reachable declaration graph (the
 * `Context` in `TabComponentProps` and the `betterSidebar` augmentation),
 * so a Node import here would leak into browser-only consumer builds. The
 * webServer faces below are therefore structural mirrors with plain
 * interfaces (the host casts to real Node types at the few boundaries that
 * need them — e.g. the `ws` upgrade hook in src/index.ts).
