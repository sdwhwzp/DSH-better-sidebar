/**
 * The plugin's view of DSH 0.1.7's `agentTeam` Session projection — the Lead
 * Session's team board, read straight off the client snapshot.
 *
 * 0.1.6 exposed the board through the experimental service's Remote vocabulary
 * (`agentTeams.remoteView`, reached over the wire) and the page had to poll it
 * every 5s. 0.1.7 deleted that trio and publishes the same state as a Session
 * projection instead: `SessionListState.projectionsBySession[leadId].values
 * .agentTeam`, loaded once per connection like every other projection. This
 * module is therefore a pure adapter — no request, no poller, no observer —
 * exactly like ./subagent-catalog.ts for the catalog.
 *
 * Two facts the durable projection does not carry are DERIVED, not invented:
 *
 * - TURN ACTIVITY. A projection row is `{ id, name, role, phase, error? }`
 *   where `phase` is the durable lifecycle (`provisioning | active | failed`,
 *   the Lead row always `active`). Whether a member is running right now comes
 *   from the session's own status — upstream's own web UI "reads the shared
 *   Session projections and overlays activity from Session status" — and this
 *   plugin already has that overlay: `subagents.live` reports EVERY tree child
 *   with an explicit `running` flag (see ./subagent-catalog.ts's `childLive`),
 *   with the session list's own coarse `running` as the fallback for the Lead.
 * - `diagnostics`, the 0.1.6 view's array of provisioning notes, collapses to
 *   the projection's single durable `error` string.
 *
 * What is genuinely gone is the member's `model` (and `description` /
 * `provider` / `context`): the wire view never carried them, so the node
 * detail no longer has a model row to show. See the design note
 * docs/plans/2026-09-27-agent-teams-dsh-0.1.7-adaptation.md.
