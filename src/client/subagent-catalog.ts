/**
 * The plugin's view of DSH 0.1.7's host-computed session projections — the
 * subagent catalog the Tasks page's topology renders, plus the two facts the
 * projection row does not carry.
 *
 * 0.1.6 published a per-parent lazy catalog through the sessions snapshot
 * (`subagentsByParent`, entries carrying `activity` / `hasChildren`) and the
 * page had to OBSERVE every parent it drew, releasing them when it hid. 0.1.7
 * replaced that whole handshake: the client loads every session's projections
 * once per connection, `SessionListState.projectionsBySession` publishes the
 * finished values, and a row is exactly `{ id, createdAt, mode, label? }`
 * (see the subagent catalog projection's `viewSchema`). So this module is a
 * pure adapter — no request, no subscription, no per-parent bookkeeping.
 *
 * The two dropped facts are derived, not invented:
 *
 * - a row HAS CHILDREN unless the child's own catalog is known-empty
 *   ({@link isKnownLeaf} — upstream's own disclosure rule, which keeps a
 *   branch open while its catalog is still loading instead of flapping it
 *   into a leaf);
 * - `activity` comes from the live channel (`subagents.live`, which folds the
 *   host's RUNNING children): a child the live map does not mention is not
 *   running ({@link childActivity}).
 *
 * What the projection genuinely does not carry any more is the 0.1.6
 * `diagnostic` row (a child whose descriptor was corrupt / unsupported /
 * unavailable): the host's fold publishes healthy identities only, so an
 * unreadable child is not a row at all and the page has nothing to show for
 * it. See the module report — no local equivalent exists.
