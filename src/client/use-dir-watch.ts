/**
 * Live refresh for the file tree.
 *
 * The tree lists a folder when it is expanded and caches the level, so
 * anything written outside the plugin — a build, a formatter, the model's own
 * `bash` — stayed invisible until the reader refreshed. DSH 0.1.7 gave its own
 * tree per-directory watching; this plugin owns its tree (it took the `files`
 * kind over), so it carries its own.
 *
 * One socket per session, open for as long as the tree is mounted. The client
 * announces the folders it has expanded and the host watches exactly those;
 * every notice names a directory whose listing is stale, and the tree drops
 * that one cached level and re-lists it. Folders the reader collapsed are
 * un-watched, so a long session does not accumulate handles.
